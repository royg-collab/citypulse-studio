# CityPulse Studio 🌆

🚀 **Live Demo:**  
https://citypulse-studio-597564223573.us-west1.run.app

CityPulse Studio is an AI-powered urban intelligence tool built using **Gemini 3** that combines CSV datasets and PDF planning documents to generate actionable city insights.


# Problem Statement

Cities generate massive amounts of data (CSVs, PDFs, planning reports), but decision-makers struggle to extract insights quickly. Manual analysis is slow, fragmented, and error-prone.

# Solution Overview

CityPulse Studio uses Gemini 3 to analyze structured (CSV) and unstructured (PDF) urban data and generate:
- Urban intelligence summaries
- Risk & opportunity analysis
- Policy recommendations

# Key Features

 Features
-  CSV data analysis (population, traffic, utilities, etc.)
-  PDF planning document understanding
-  AI-generated urban intelligence summaries
-  Zone-level recommendations
-  Fast, interactive AI Studio UI

## Gemini 3 Integration

CityPulse Studio leverages Gemini 3 for:
- Multimodal reasoning across CSV + PDF inputs
- Long-context document understanding
- Insight synthesis and recommendation generation
- Natural language interaction with city data

## Architecture

1. User uploads CSV and/or PDF
2. Data is parsed and normalized
3. Gemini 3 processes structured + unstructured inputs
4. Insights and recommendations are generated
5. Results are displayed in the AI Studio UI
